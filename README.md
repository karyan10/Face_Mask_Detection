MaskGuard - Real-Time Face Mask Detection System

In response to the critical need for enhanced safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, I spearheaded the development and implementation of MaskGuard, a cutting-edge real-time face mask detection system. Leveraging advanced technologies including Keras, TensorFlow, MobileNet, and OpenCV, MaskGuard stands as a robust solution to detect individuals wearing or not wearing face masks accurately.

Through meticulous training on a diverse dataset using deep learning techniques, MaskGuard ensures high levels of accuracy and reliability in identifying face masks in real-time scenarios. This innovative system has been seamlessly integrated into various public spaces such as airports, hospitals, and schools, playing a crucial role in enforcing safety protocols and curbing the spread of the virus.

Documenting the project's methodology comprehensively, I have provided insights into model training procedures and system integration techniques, facilitating easy replication and further development by other organizations. MaskGuard represents a significant contribution towards public health and safety, demonstrating the power of technology to address pressing societal challenges.
